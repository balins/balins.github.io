# the author

My name is Jakub Baliński. I am a computer science student and part-time
programmer, who's learning the ropes in the IT world.

I have a great passion for learning and I love exploring new fields of
computer science, so you can expect to find here a broad variety of topics
related to it, such as programming languages, software development, statistics,
math, data science, machine learning, the cloud, Linux distros and whatnot.

On the personal side, I enjoy watching good movies and playing video games
(especially those story-driven!). I love listening to podcasts about other
countries, cultures (especially the Eastern) and events that take place
all around the world.

# the blog

The idea to start my own blog and document the things I learn had been crossing
my mind for many months. However, I had never felt ready to put it into effect,
because I've never considered myself an expert at any field I wanted to write about.
One day, I realized that due to the good old rule saying "the more you know,
the more you realize how much you don't know" I will probably never reach this point.

Finally, on 27th February 2021, I've decided to start this blog and regularly
share the things I learn with the world.  

At its foundation this blog is serving me as a kind of travel diary, that I
plan to keep during my journey into the unknown of computer science.

_Okay, one more reason why I finally made up my mind and launched this blog
was that I was supposed to finally start working on my bachelor's thesis :grin:_

# the purpose

I want to solidify my knowledge.  
I want to give back to the community.  
I want to share my point of view with others.  
I want to become a better communicator and teacher.  
I want to share things I find not getting deserved attention.

Hopefully, someday this blog will become a place where everyone willing to
grow their passion for computer science will be able to find something
for themselves right here.
