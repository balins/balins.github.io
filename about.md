# The author

My name is Jakub Bali≈Ñski. I am a computer science student and part-time
programmer, who's learning the ropes in the IT world.

I have a great passion for learning and I love exploring new fields of
computer science, so you can expect to find here a broad variety of topics
related to it, such as programming languages, software development, statistics,
math, data science, machine learning, the cloud, Linux distros and whatnot.

On the personal side, I enjoy watching good movies and playing video games
(especially these story-driven!). I love listening to podcasts about other
countries, cultures (mainly the Eastern) and events that take place
all around the world.

# The blog

The idea to start my own blog and note down the things I learn had been crossing
my mind for many months. However, I had never felt ready to put it into effect,
because I've never considered myself an expert at any field.

One day I realized that, according to the good old rule saying *"the more you
know, the more you realize how much you don't know"*, I will probably never
reach this point.

Finally, on 27th February 2021, I've decided to start this blog and regularly
share the things I learn with others.  

<small>*Okay, I have to admit that another reason for me finally starting this
blog was being supposed to work hard on my bachelor's thesis :grin:*</small>

At its foundation this blog is serving me as a kind of travel diary, that I
plan to keep during my journey into the unknown of computer science. However, it
will be great if one day it will become a source of knowledge for other people!

# The purpose

I want to solidify my knowledge.  
I want to give back to the community.  
I want to share my point of view with others.  
I want to become a better communicator and teacher.  
I want to share things I find not getting deserved attention.
