*__Hooray!__ This is the very first blog post here!* :tada:

My name is Jakub Baliński, and I'm the author of this blog. This place will
become my "travel diary", where I will share with you updates on my journey
through the intricacies of computer science. It would be great if along the way,
something I will have learned and written down will turn out to be useful for
someone else :smile:

Hopefully, soon enough I will be able to fill this place with lots of great
content related to my fields of interest. You can expect to find here a lot of
random stuff, all sharing a common denominator — computer science and tech.

I don't want to spend too much time writing this "hello, world"-ish post, so
if you are curious, you can find out more information about me and this blog
simply by visiting ["about" page](/about).

Meanwhile, let's get back to work!
